PROJECT 3: DNS RESOLVER
JORDAN SUTTON - MATTHEW FRAHRY
=========================================================================
TO THE GRADER:
=========================================================================

Still trying to work on the rrsig, but it should work for ipv4 and ipv6


NOTICE:

There was one case, we emailed you about. we ran into a MNAME type. I figured we 
didn't need to worry about this case. 




=========================================================================
TO RUN THE PROGRAM: 
=========================================================================
(type the following in a terminal window)

>myresolver www.nlnetlabs.nl AAAA
....

=========================================================================
DESCRIPTION OF TASK: 
=========================================================================
Write a program that implements a DNS resolver that will look up IPv4 (A records)
or IPv6 (AAAA records) along with their digital signitures. 

When running the program:
the resolver then issues a series or iterative queries to obtain the IPv6 or IPv4 addresses along with any DNSSEC signitures (RRSIG records)
for the hostname.

NOTE: not all domain names have DNSSEC. 




=========================================================================
CHECKLIST: 
=========================================================================
-sending/Reading packets
-iteratively working
-Ipv4
-IPv6



=========================================================================
TODO:
=========================================================================
-RRSIG:
    What we need to do is look at our packet and how it is sent
    in the additinal section we need to set a flag (see RRSIG wireshark example) Then just read the answer if it is 46. 

-Timeout:

-Picking correct servers to hit:
    (create a function that takes the string and converts it into the byte[]
     so that way we can check to make sure that they are the same ip from the packet??????)


-Testing:
    - what does our code do for an NXDOMAIN
    -domain exists but are not signed????
    -the a or AAAA exist but are not signed
    -if original name is a cname continue looking or chain the cnames 
    -if server is down try a different server -- how to check for this?
    -etc. look at specs.

Make sure to run the commands for (wwww.nlnetlabs.com AAAA and www.cnn.com A)
and put them into a file named "OutputFile"
